# Here are your Instructions
 Install npm in frontend folder
 Run the server and run npm
 Here is a step-by-step guide to accomplish the tasks:
 Backend: Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies
 Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal.
 Create a virtual environment using:
 For Windows: 
python -m venv venv
 For macOS/Linux: 
python3 -m venv venv
 Activate the virtual environment:
 Windows: 
venv\Scripts\activate
 macOS/Linux: 
source venv/bin/activate
 Install all dependencies listed in 
requirements.txt
 :
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 Frontend: Install npm
 Navigate to your frontend folder.
 npm install
 to install all dependencies from 
Run the command 
npm packages locally in the folder).
 Running Server and Frontend
 package.json
 (this installs
 To run your backend server, use the command relevant to your backend (e.g., for FastAPI
 uvicorn main:app --reload
 , or whatever fits your framework).
 To start the frontend development server, run:
 npm start
  This typically runs the script defined in  package.json
 under "start" or "dev".

  Optional: Running Backend and Frontend Together
  If you want to run both simultaneously in the same terminal, you can use the 
concurrently
 npm
 package:

  Install it in frontend or root folder:
 npm install concurrently --save-dev

  Add a script in 
package.json
 scripts section like:
 "scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently \"cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload\" \"cd frontend && n
 }
 Run both with
  npm run dev
   This will start both backend and frontend servers simultaneously.
 If you want, I can provide exact commands for your specific backend framework and frontend
 setup. Let me know if you need that.
 This covers creating and activating the backend virtual environment, installing backend and
 frontend packages, and running both servers.
